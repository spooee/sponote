# sponote

A simple application written in the Flutter framework that lets the user create folders & notes to help manage their every-day thoughts. It was developed to get experience with the framework (and because I wanted a personal one to use :]).

sponote is a Flutter-based notes application with an ASP.NET Core API + MariaDB database.
